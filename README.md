# Facebook_API
Use the Facebook API to collect all comments from The New York Times posts between 9/20/2017-9/26/2017

As part of a course, Ruixin and I were asked to first use the Facebook API to collect all comments. We then will use Amazon MTurk to crowd sourcing to vote on which comments are personal attacks or not. This will lead us to do analysis on the comments and see what proportion of comments are of different type of attacks.

This analysis was then compared to our classmate's same analysis on the WSJ.
